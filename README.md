## Challenges and Solutions:
 - One of the key challenges I faced during the development was creating the custom slider that was specified in the UI design. The built-in Flutter sliders didn't meet the exact design requirements, particularly in terms 
   of style and interactivity. To overcome this, I implemented the slider using a custom approach.
